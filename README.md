This example demonstrates a common misconception when using the `map()` function with mutable lists in Kotlin.  Many developers expect the original list to be modified, but `map()` returns a new list without changing the original. This README explains the behavior and provides a solution.  The `bug.kt` file shows the erroneous code and the `bugSolution.kt` demonstrates the correct approach.
